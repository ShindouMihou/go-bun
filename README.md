# go-bun

some little fun experimentation and remake of random stuff from other languages. initially, this was to remake the cool  
interfaces that bun.sh had for files, but then expanded to figuring out how to remake stuff from other languages.

what does go-bun have:
- [`promises`](examples/promises.go): literally javascript promises, but dumbed down and made into a linked-list structure.
- [`try-catch`](examples/try-catch.go): literally java and javscript try-catch, but dumbed down.
- [`files`](examples/files.go): literally bun.sh's files interface, dumbed for golang.
